Do Not Disturb (DND) Scheduler Android App - README

Overview

This app automatically turns on/off Do Not Disturb mode based on your university class timetable.
It scrapes your timetable from the university portal, stores it locally, and then uses scheduled alarms to control DND status.

Architecture Overview

Key Classes

LoginActivity: Handles authentication and HTML timetable scraping

TimetableStore: Parses raw HTML into class slots with time ranges

ClassTimeSlot: Model class with startMillis, endMillis, subject

DNDManager: Core scheduler, manages all alarms and DND logic

DNDReceiver: BroadcastReceiver for turning DND on/off and rescheduling alarms

How Scheduling Works

1. Parse Timetable HTML

From the scraped HTML, class periods like:
<td class="TDtimetableHour">09:00-10:00</td>

Are extracted, and matched with days (Mon, Tue...) into ClassTimeSlot objects.

2. Schedule Alarms for Whole Week

For each ClassTimeSlot, DNDManager schedules:

A TURN_ON_DND alarm at start time

A TURN_OFF_DND alarm at end time

3. Exact Alarms
alarmManager.setExactAndAllowWhileIdle(
    AlarmManager.RTC_WAKEUP,
    triggerTime,
    pendingIntent
Ensures the alarm fires precisely even in Doze mode.

4. Rescheduling

When the alarm triggers, DNDReceiver calls rescheduleAlarmAfterTrigger()
to re-register the alarm for the next week at the same day and time.
